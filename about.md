* Break the communication barrier between management and IT Professionals.
* Explain subjects in laymans term and assume the audience has no technical background.
* Carry out conversations with IT Professionals effectively by getting familiar with their jargons and even share humour with them!
* For Technical Recruiters, avoid making mistakes in job posting which could result into getting the wrong candidate for the job.
* Understand the context of technical conversations by your staff (for auditing and human resource management)
