Thank you for checking out this site. This site is specifically written for people who would like to have a more effective way of managing software projects that involves communicating with developers/programmers/software engineers -- which is oftentime a challenge! 

Whether you are trying to produce some mobile app, website or a software for certain business process, ensuring that your programmers understand what you are trying to achieve is very important. Sometimes it would be more efficient to explain it in a level that the coders will understand rather than letting them read between through the lines. 

The following are sample scenarios you will encounter in a workplace that coud had been easily solved if non-tech people have at least a basic understanding and context of the technical aspects of the project.

### Mismatch of output vs the objectives

This usually happens when passing down down a very high level objective, such as  "optimize for mobile app". The coders spent hours refactoring the site for iPhones and and Android Phones,  just to find out that in Google Analytics that most of these "mobile users" that the business people referring to involves tablet users. It is too late to find out your team has been spending hours developing for the wrong target users!
